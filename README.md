# Privacy By Design: The game

Funded by the National Science Foundation, the Privacy By Design project aims to locate 
methods to encourage developers to consider ethical and user-centered design when 
building mobile or web apps. One method we have explored is the use of interactive 
games and simulations for developers and students in computer science, information 
science, and other technology based courses. This game is a product of that research. 

This game asks participants to imagine they are working for a health company 
that is building a Glucose Monitoring App for users to monitor their glucose
levels throughout the day. Over the course of the game, your team will be 
making two types of decisions: what data will you collect for the app and 
what data will you share from the app. Unfortunately, every decision has a 
cost. Participants take different roles which have their own secret 
motivations that may shape their decision making process.
