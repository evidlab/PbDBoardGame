The Rules: Privacy by Design (PbD) Card Game

Context:
Video + Donal script for a class
Need to describe current service and/or have the team decide current service, future services

Set-up:
Pick a role!
Decide who on your team will be the:
Manager - optimize for profits (calculated as “developer time” in the game)
Developer - optimize for functionality
UX - optimize for user trust
Your team begins with two types of resources: 25 resources in developer time and 25 resources in user trust. You will spend these resources, or earn more of them, depending on the choices you make in your policy.
Your goal: to implement a privacy policy for your app company. What data will you collect, and who will you share it with?
As you play, you will use resources to fill out the game board (privacy policy). Your team will cooperate to make decisions about each element of your policy.
If you spend developer time or user trust to make your decision, put the required number of resources in the bank. If you earn developer time or user trust, take the number of resources from the bank.

Losing:
If you run out of developer resources or user trust at any point in the game, the game is over. You do not have a winning development strategy.

Winning:
Beloved but outdated: 1-10 dev resources, 25+ user trust: You have a product users really trust, but it was expensive to develop. You win, but product updates for this product, or your next product, may be delayed or postponed indefinitely.
Bleeding edge, bleeding users: 25+ dev resources, 1-10 user trust: You have a top of the line product that you developed efficiently, but users are never sure whether they can trust you. You win, but your brand is troubled, and you may have trouble attracting users to your next product.
Middle of the road: 10-25 dev resources, 10-25 user trust: Your balanced strategy played it safe. You’re neither an industry superstar nor a fan favorite, but you have a solid development and user retention strategy.

Game Play:
As a team, make decisions about the How We Use Information columns for the first row (demographic information) of the board.
Decide whether you will collect demographic data, and what purposes you will use it for.
Each decision will have a cost or benefit in developer time  and user trust .  
The costs and benefits of deciding to collect are represented in red; the costs and benefits of deciding not to collect are represented in blue.
